### Technical Details

#### Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+, Prisma ORM

- [ ] Multi-user authentication
- [ ] CSV export functionality
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Mobile apps (React Native)
- [ ] Integration with more ATS systems
- [ ] Real-time push notifications from email providers
- [ ] Advanced analytics and insights
- [ ] Interview preparation features
- [ ] Salary tracking and negotiation tools

## Release Notes

This is the initial MVP release of the Job Application Tracker. The focus has been on:

1. **Reliability**: Robust parsing with fallback mechanisms
2. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Clarity**: Clean code architecture and documentation

The system is production-ready for personal use or small teams. Email integration requires OAuth credentials from Google/Microsoft.
